# ZergEco
This was a C++ project that I threw together to try to determine the most efficient/quickest build to achieve a specific desired eco (set to 6k) in a Starcraft 2 Arcade game called Zerg Hex. After some experimentation and thinking, we discovered that to get the "perfect" build for a select eco, we would have to simulate every scenario. I might do this later once I have more knowledge of neural networks. For now, this gives is the next best thing.
